You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  
* What new skills have you learned?
  I learned what the <sup> (suprscript) element does and also the importance of checking your work.  
* What has been easy?
  The entire mockup project was relatively easy because I have some experience with creating a webpage while using a mockup as a reference. 
* What has been difficult?
 Nothing was difficult.   
* How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

 
The MDN reference site was very helpful with my research of unfamiliar elements.
